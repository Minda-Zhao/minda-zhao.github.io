I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), Georgia Institute of Technology (Gatech). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xin Chen](https://sites.gatech.edu/xin-chen/). Before transferring to Gatech ISyE, I spent one year in the [Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I obtained my MS in Computational and Applied Mathematics from UChicago (2020) and BS in Information and Computing Science from SYSU (2019).

My research interests lie in convex and nonconvex optimization with applications in inventory control.
