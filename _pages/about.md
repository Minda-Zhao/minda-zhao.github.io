I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), Georgia Institute of Technology (Gatech). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xin Chen](https://sites.gatech.edu/xin-chen/). Before joining Gatech ISyE, I spent one year in the [Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
